This is my calendar. It has full functionality for month by month view. Users can register and log in safely. Users can double click on a valid day in a month to add an event to that day. Users will be prompted to input the name, description, and time (army time). It will save and update the calendar using AJAX. Users can then edit or remove their event by hovering over the event and selecting the right option. If you choose to invite a friend, it will make sure the friend exists in the database then invite them. If successful the friend's calendar will be updated to show the newly added event. From there the event is personal to the user so each individual person associated with the event can decide to edit or remove the event on their calendar. I also added a description which is shown as you hover over an event.

An account that exists with dates already is username: ben password: pass and username: tom password: test. These two accounts have an event in common that tom shared with ben that appears on both calendars.
